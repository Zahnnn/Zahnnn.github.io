            <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
            <p>This week I am <em><b>extremely</b></em> excited about a new cooking technique
            called <i>sous vide</i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food
            <i>usually vacuum-sealed in plastic</i> into a water bath that is
            precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be
            cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes
            it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
            <p><small> Month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill
            Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
            before November 30.</small></p>

            <p> Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it
            if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
